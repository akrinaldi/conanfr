# contentan
This is a repository for the contentan content analysis package.
The point of this package is to allow users to easily tabulate and compare this frequency data. These functions proved useful to me in my content analysis research, so I am happy to compile them and share them with other researchers who use R.
The package focussing mainly on descriptive statistics, giving the user the ability to find, isolate, tabulate, and graph modes/frequency data, as well as providing a couple of other functions for traditional graphing and finding range. When doing content analysis, often times researchers code data based on categories for themes, tones, or other data. When researchers compile this data into larger spreadsheets, especially when the sample sizes are large, the overall trends are not easily visible, so using R to find these data trends can save users a lot of time. While other platforms can give these descriptive statistics, R's capacity for summation and visualization can add a lot to the interpretation of results and allow researchers to do a lot of work in one spot.
