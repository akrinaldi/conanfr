# contentan
This is a repository for the contentan content analysis package.
The point of this package is to allow users to easily tabulate and compare frequency data for content analysis research. 
This package focusses mainly on descriptive statistics, giving the user the ability to find, isolate, tabulate, and graph modes/frequency data, as well as providing a couple of other functions for traditional graphing and finding range. Users will find these functions useful for finding trends in coded data in value, chart, and visualization form.
This package requires that the user has ggplot2 installed and loaded for the varvvar and ghist functions to work.
I created and used these functions for content analysis research that I did, so I hope that others will find them useful for their work as well.
