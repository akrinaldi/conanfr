# contentan
This is a repository for the contentan content analysis package.
The point of this package is to allow users to easily tabulate and compare frequency data for content analysis research. The functions included in this package proved useful to me in my content analysis research, so I am happy to compile them and share them with other researchers who use R.
This package focusses mainly on descriptive statistics, giving the user the ability to find, isolate, tabulate, and graph modes/frequency data, as well as providing a couple of other functions for traditional graphing and finding range. Users will find these functions useful for finding trends in coded data in value, chart, and visualization form.
This package requires that the user have ggplot2 installed and loaded in order for the varvvar and ghist functions to work.
